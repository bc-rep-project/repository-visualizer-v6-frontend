   - Code complexity metrics
   - File type distribution

3. **Interactive Elements**
   - Search functionality
   - Filtering options
   - Zoom and pan controls
   - Detailed tooltips

## Components

- **FileTypesChart**: Displays distribution of file types in a doughnut chart
- **DirectoryStructure**: Interactive tree view of the repository structure
- **CodeMetrics**: Shows key metrics about the codebase
- **FunctionsClassesList**: Lists all functions and classes with filtering options
- **RepositoryOverview**: Provides a summary of repository statistics

## Usage

Navigate through the different visualizations using the buttons in the top-right corner of the visualization panel. Use the tabs at the bottom to access different views of the repository data.

## Data Processing

The visualization processes the raw repository data to extract:
- File and directory structure
- Code dependencies
- Function and class relationships
- Size and complexity metrics

This data is then transformed into various visualization formats for different views.
